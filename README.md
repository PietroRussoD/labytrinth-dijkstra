# Implementation of Dijkstra algorithm in a labyrinth

The application draws a randomly generated labyrinth and marks a start node and an end node. 
With the Dijkstra's algorithm is determined the shortest path between the nodes. This is achievable because the labyrinth is converted into a weighted adjacency matrix. 

## Built With
The project is been developed with [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and [python](https://www.python.org/) (3.4 or more).
